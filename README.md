<h1> <b>Employees Promotion Prediction - Machine Learning 2023</b> </h1>

As part of Machine Learning project we will use an HR Dataset containing employees data taken by <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/hr-ana">Kaggle</a>. </br>
While using the dataset above we are trying to predict if an employee will be promoted or not and what are the factors that have an impact in employee promotion by using Machine Learning Algorithms.


**Project steps that we will take:**

<ul>
<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    <ul>
      <li>EDA will be performed to understand the distribution of promoted employees;</li>
    </ul> 
  </li>
  <li>Data Preprocessing:
    <ul>
      <li>The dataset will be preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, checking for outliers and more;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>  
  <li>Model Selection:
    <ul>
      <li>For model selection we will use some supervised algorithms and also deep learning. Supervised models that we will use include: Logistic Regression, Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Model Evaluation:
    <ul>
      <li>We will evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
    </ul>
